# keep-my-cat-2025

A remake of an original interactive story game [I made 8 years ago](https://github.com/weilidai2001/keep-my-cat) when Node was on version 9, styling was done using SASS + BEM notation, React components were defined as Class components and every component method has to use .bind(this) to bind the context in the constructor.

This project shall be done in NextJS with TypeScript and TailwindCSS. The previous game's logic will move from client-side to server-side.
